# Large Downtown Hotel
### Chicago, IL

During this three-year project, Tecnica Environmental Services was in charge of asbestos and lead based paint abatement of eight floors with numerous phases. The hotel is one of Chicagoâ€™s best and most beautiful hotels requiring sensitivity not only to its guests, but also to the building itself.  The unique structural design made this project one of the most challenging for our company.  Everything from scheduling of material deliveries, to the amount of noise generation from the work area had to be approved by management.
